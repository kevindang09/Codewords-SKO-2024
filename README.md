# CODEWORDS SKO 2024
## RMIT CODEWORDS CREATIVE CODING AND TYPOGRAPHY STUDIO 
Melbourne, Australia

This studio, Codewords Creative Coding and Typography, is a 12-weeks course that explores and engages with the creative possibilities of computer code and scripting. The studio will be guided by Karen Ann Donnachie and Andy Simionato through a series of theoretical and practical workshops. By integrating computer programming with typography during the course, I have expanded my design practice and investigate how reading and writing are evolving in the digital age. Through this combination of code and text, I have discovered new ways to express ideas and push the boundaries of modern communication. As an UXUI design student, I seek to apply drawing from critical texts on art and language, and transform these concepts into original, code-driven typographic expressions.

Through Codewords Creative Coding and Typography studio, I have gained invaluable insights into the intersection of technology and design, particularly how coding can shape and transform typographic expression. I have learned how to leverage programming as a creative tool, enabling me to visualize and manipulate language in dynamic ways that would be impossible through traditional design alone. This experience has deepened my understanding of how reading and writing are evolving in the digital landscape, allowing me to bridge the gap between conceptual thinking and technical execution. Additionally, engaging with critical texts on art and language has enhanced my ability to interpret and translate complex ideas into compelling visual formats, enriching your design practice with a unique, digitally informed perspective. 

I've also gained a variety of techniques for addressing design challenges. For example, in the activity Other’s Project, I was asked to present my friend’s project idea and layout but found I could only recall about 30% of the project details. This exercise highlighted a critical insight: even with strong ideas and a clear philosophy in mind, effectively communicating them to an audience requires a different skill set. I learned the importance of distilling my rationale into a concise, impactful message that resonates clearly and memorably.

In my future design practice, I’ll draw heavily on the skills gained, particularly the integration of code with typographic design. Techniques such as creating dynamic, responsive website layouts through coding will be invaluable as I develop more interactive and digitally-forward projects. Understanding the power of concise, impactful messaging will also help me engage audiences more effectively in future projects. This will guide my approach to each stage of design, from initial research through final presentation, ensuring that my work is both thoughtfully crafted and accessible. Emphasizing empathy in the research phase and using mapping techniques to refine my ideas will help create projects that resonate on a deeper, more impactful level.
