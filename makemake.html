      <p>This is an activity we have conducted as a group of 5 during class, which involve finding a vintage video game that we like; try to replicate it in the simplest way using paper prototype. This is to get a clearer idea of how it should be presented in Assignment 1.</p>

          <p>This activity is to break away from the norm, encourage students to think creatively upon approaching the layout of the website and typography design.</p>

        <p>This activity helps me to unpack the meaning of the words and look at it in a creative way. The more I think about one specific words, the more ideas flow through. I had produced some concrete poetries through activity Crazy Eights, and it surprises my how much typography I could absorb in such a short time.</p>

        <p>Pick a reading from the suggested reading list and identify a quote and meaning related to the design/creative field [photo] -> this is the practice on how to choose and analyse if the quote is substantial for both Assignment 1 and 2. Identify the quote’s contexts, relation and meaning. Preparing 3 essential steps include: reading, sketching and prototyping.</p>

         <div class="imageHolder"> <div class="image">
          <image src="Data/Potrait.png" alt="Solitude Space" width="100%"></div></div>
        <p>Produce a portrait in children’s style drawing (minimal and clear). Write instruction on how to draw it as if telling the computer how to draw it. This activity is to get the right mindset on how to work the computer before learning code. Get the portrait and instruction ready for the coding session.</p>

        <p>Draw something I see on the way to class that morning in children’s drawing style (minimal and clear). Write instruction on how to draw it. Hand the instruction to peers and see if they are able to replicate the drawings using your instructions. </p>

       <p> This activity involves 2 or more people in a group. Random person is assigned to talk about peer’s project from the previous week’s presentation. This is a great way to know that people often do not listen or read everything you say, so you need to be able to solidify a strong, short and concise
