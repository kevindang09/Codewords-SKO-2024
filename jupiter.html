      <p>Process: In this task, I chose a short sentence of 10 words and create a paper prototype for a screen-based interactive media work. This task focuses only on the paper prototype, not the coded version, which will come later in the major assignment. The paper prototype should be interactive, involving me and another person acting as the "user" to simulate a screen-based experience.
      <br><br>Achievement: Exploring theories of reading and language in the digital space has informed my design practice by showing how people interpret and engage with content online. Applying concepts like visual literacy and multimodality helps me create user-friendly, interactive designs. Experimental methods in design research, such as prototyping and testing, allow me to translate these theories into practical solutions. Engaging with peers through testing provides essential feedback, enabling me to refine and improve my designs iteratively, ensuring they are effective and user-centered.
      <br><br>Challanges: I initially struggled to find a suitable quote and relevant readings for the assignment, which left me feeling stuck. I also found it challenging to think creatively and explore new ideas beyond the usual approaches. This made it difficult to make progress and highlighted the need for patience and seeking different perspectives to overcome creative blocks.
      <br><br>Feedback: This is a powerful concept, well-designed and professionally presented. The project is concise, to the point and doesn't waste time on unneccessary details. Be sure to include proper citations for your sources. Leave time for feedback and iterative versions and you will achieve some great outcomes.</p>

      <p>Process: In this assignment, I conducted research, create, code, and publish a digital creative coding interpretation of an excerpt from one of the critical texts on art and language. Creative coding involves using interactive, multimedia, and generative content in imaginative ways. As an individual, my final published project is a website hosted on GitHub. 
      <br><br>Achievement: Theories of reading and language in digital spaces guide me in designing user-friendly and engaging experiences. Creative coding enhances my skills in interactive typography and communication design. Contemporary practices in immersive environments teach me to combine storytelling and interactivity effectively. Learning new platforms like GitHub, Processing, and Visual Studio Code further supports my development in these areas.
      <br><br>Challanges: I initially faced challenges with the design layout, as my first approach was ineffective. I also encountered technical difficulties with 3D WEBGL, which were frustrating. However, I eventually overcame these obstacles by independently learning more about WEBGL, refining my skills, and adjusting my approach to the design.
      <br><br>Feedback: I’ve created a solid foundation with engaging ideas, and my hook question and quote are effective. While parts of my prototype are valuable for my major project, I realize it’s too linear and limits user interaction. This rigidity makes it difficult for users to explore the intended message, as they cannot navigate back or move between different stages. Thus, I have made changes to tackle those issues.</p>
